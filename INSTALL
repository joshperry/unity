Synergy Installation Instructions
=================================

Prerequisites for building
--------------------------

To build synergy from the sources you'll need the following:

  Windows:
  * VC++ 6.0 or up

  Linux:
  * gcc 2.95 (or up?)
  * X11R4 or up headers and libraries


Configuring the build
---------------------

This step is only necessary when building on Linux.

To configure the build for your platform use the configure script:

  ./configure

For a list of options to configure use:

  ./configure --help


Building
--------

Windows:
  Start VC++ and open `synergy.dsw'.  Set the active configuration
  (Build | Set Active Configuration) to `All - Debug' or `All - Release'
  then build.  Binaries are built into ./Debug or ./Release.

Linux:
  Simply enter:

    make

  This will build the client and server and leave them in their
  respective source directories.


Installing
----------

Windows:
  There is no support for creating an installer for synergy or installing
  the files in a particular location.  Instead, just copy the following
  files from the Debug or Release directory to a directory you choose
  (perhaps under the Program Files directory):

  * synergy.exe
  * synergyc.exe
  * synergys.exe
  * synrgyhk.dll

Linux:
    make install

  will install the client and server into /usr/local/bin unless you
  specified a different directory when you ran configure.

See `Starting Automatically on ...' below for details on how to have
synergy start up automatically when the computer starts.


Running on Windows
------------------

Double click `synergy' on the server computer.  The server is the
computer who's mouse and keyboard will be shared.  This brings up a
dialog that lets you configure the server then test out the
configuration or start the server.

First configure the server.  Click the `Server' radio button

  * Click the `Server' radio button
  * Click `Add' to add the server to the `Screens' list
    * Enter the name of server (the computer name is recommended)
    * Enter other names the server is known by
    * Click OK
  * Use `Add' to add your other computers
  * Use the controls under `Layout' to link screens together
    * Click (once) on the server's name in the `Screens' list
    * Choose the screen to the left of the server
      * Use `---' if there is no screen to the left of the server
    * Choose the screens to the right, above and below the server
    * Repeat the above steps for all the other screens
  * Enter the server's screen name next to `Screen Name'
    * This defaults to the computer's name (recommended)
  * Click `Test'

The server will start and you'll see a console window with log messages
telling you about synergy's progress.  If an error occurs you'll get one
or more dialog boxes telling you what the errors are;  read the errors
to determine the problem then correct them and try `Test' again.

Now that the server is running, you'll need to start a client.  On any
client computer, double click `synergy'.  Of course, you'll need to
have installed the four files listed under `Installing' above on the
client computer.  Then configure the client:

  * Click the `Client' radio button
  * Enter the server's computer name in `Server Host Name'
    * Do not use any of the server's screen names, unless one of those
      is also the computer name
  * Enter the client's screen name next to `Screen Name'
    * This defaults to the computer's name (recommended)
    * This must be one of the names in the server's `Screens' list
  * Click `Test'

If all goes well, the client connects to the server successfully and
the mouse and keyboard are shared.  If an error occurs you'll get one
or more dialog boxes telling you  what the errors are;  read the errors
to determine the problem then correct them and try `Test' again.  When
everything is working correctly, install the software on the other
client computers (if any) and repeat the steps for configuring the
client on each.

See `Starting Automatically on Windows' below for configuring synergy
to start automatically when the computer starts.


Configuring the Server on Linux
-------------------------------

The synergy server requires configuration.  The configuration file is a
plain text file broken into sections.  Each section has the form:

  section: <name>
    <args>
  end

Comments are introduced by `#' and continue to the end of the line.
The file can have the following sections.

  * screens
    <args> is a list of screen names, one name per line, each
    followed by a colon.  Names are arbitrary strings but they
    must be unique.  The hostname of each computer is recommended.
    There must be a screen name for the server and each client.

	Example:

      section: screens
    	moe:
    	larry:
    	curly:
      end

    This declares three screens named:  moe, larry, and curly.

  * links
    <args> is a list of screen names just like in the `screens'
    section except each screen is followed by a list of links.
    Each link has the form `<left|right|up|down> = <name>'.
    A link indicates which screen is adjacent in the given
    direction.

    Example:

      section: links
        moe:
          right = larry
          up    = curly
        larry:
          left  = moe
          up    = curly
        curly:
          down  = larry
      end

    This indicates that screen `larry' is to the right of screen
    `moe' (so moving the cursor off the right edge of moe would
    make it appear at the left edge of larry), `curly' is above
    'moe', `moe' is to the left of `larry', `curly' is above
    `larry', and `larry' is below `curly'.  Note that links do
    not have to be symmetrical;  moving up from moe then down
    from curly lands the cursor on larry.

  * aliases
    <args> is a list of screen names just like in the `screens'
    section except each screen is followed by a list of aliases,
    one per line *not* followed by a colon.  An alias is a
    screen name and must be unique.  During screen name lookup
    each alias is equivalent to the screen name it aliases.  So
    a client can connect using its canonical screen name or any
    of its aliases.  

    Example:

      section: aliases
        larry:
          larry.stooges.com
        curly:
          shemp
      end

    Screen `larry' is also known as `larry.stooges.com' and can
    connect as either name.  Screen `curly' is also known as
    `shemp'.  (Hey, it's just an example.)

The synergy server will try certain pathnames to load the configuration
file if the user doesn't specify a path using the `--config' command
line option.  `synergys --help' reports those pathnames.


Running the Server on Linux
---------------------------

Run the server on the computer that has the keyboard and mouse to
be shared.  You must have prepared a configuration file before
starting the server.  The server should be started before the
clients but that's not required.

Run the synergy server on the server system using the following
command line:

  synergys -f --config <config-pathname>

Replace <config-pathname> with the path to the configuration file.
The `-f' option causes synergys to run in the foreground.  This is
recommended until you've verified that the configuration works.
If you didn't include the system's hostname in the configuration
file (either as a screen name or an alias) then you'll have to add
`--name <screen-name>' to the command line, where <screen-name> is
a name in the configuration file.  You can use `synergys --help'
for a list of command line options.

See `Starting Automatically on Linux' below for running synergy
automatically when the X server starts.


Running the Client on Linux
---------------------------

Run the client on all computers that aren't the server using the
following command line:

  synergyc -f --no-camp <server-hostname>

Replace <server-hostname> with the hostname or address of the
server system.  The `-f' option causes synergy to run in the
foreground.  The `--no-camp' prevents synergy from retrying to
connect to the server until it succeeds.  Both are recommended
until you've verified that the configuration works.  If you
didn't include the system's hostname in the configuration file
(either as a screen name or an alias) then you'll have to add
`--name <screen-name>' to the command line, where <screen-name>
is a name in the configuration file.

The client should quickly report `connected to server'.  If it
does not but doesn't print an error and exit immediately then
it's trying to connect to the server but cannot.  It will time
out in 30 seconds and exit (use ctrl+c to exit earlier).  You
should check that the server is running and is reachable over
the network and try again.

If the client fails and exits it should print an error describing
the problem.  Here are typical problems and possible solutions:

  * failed to open screen:
      check permission to open the X display;
      check that the DISPLAY environment variable is set.
  * already connected:
      check that the synergy client isn't already running.
  * refused client:
      add client to the server's configuration file.
  * connection failed:
      check <server-hostname>;
      the server cannot open the desired port, stop the
      program using that port (24800) and restart the
      server.

Once all the clients are running, try moving the mouse to each
screen.  Be sure to check all the configured links. 

See `Starting Automatically on Linux' below for running synergy
automatically when the X server starts.


Starting Automatically on Windows
---------------------------------

When all the clients work you're ready to have synergy start
automatically each time the system (re)starts.  Click `Stop' on all
the clients then on the server'.  Now click the `Configure' button by
the text `Automatic Startup'.  The `Auto Start' dialog will pop up.
If an error occurs then correct the problem and click `Configure'
again.

On the `Auto Start' dialog you'll configure synergy to start
automatically when the computer starts or when you log in.  You can
also configure synergy to not start automatically.  You can only
start synergy automatically when the computer starts if you have
sufficient access rights.  The dialog will let you know if you have
sufficient permission.

If synergy is already configured to automatically start then there
will be two `Uninstall' buttons, at most one of which is enabled.
Click the enabled button, if any, to configure synergy to not start
automatically.

If synergy is not configured to start automatically then there will
be two `Install' buttons.  If you have sufficient permission to
have synergy start automatically when the computer does then the
`Install' button in the `When Computer Starts' box will be enabled.
Click it to have synergy start for all users when the computer starts.
In this case, synergy will be available during the login screen.
Otherwise, click the `Install' button in the `When You Log In' box
to have synergy automatically start when you log in.


Starting Automatically on Linux
-------------------------------

Linux:
  Synergy requires an X server.  That means a server must be
  running and synergy must be authorized to connect to that server.
  It's best to have the display manager start synergy.  You'll need
  the necessary (probably root) permission to modify the display
  manager configuration files.  If you don't have that permission
  you can start synergy after logging in via the .xsession file.

  To have the display manager start synergy, edit the Xsetup script.
  The location of this file depends on your installation.  It might
  be /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup.  Near the end of the file but before
  anyplace the script calls exit, start the client with something
  like:

    /usr/bin/killall synergyc
    /usr/local/bin/synergyc [<options>] <server-host-name>

  <options> must not include `-f' or `--no-daemon'.  Change the
  paths as necessary.  It's important to make sure no old copies
  of synergy are running so they can't interfere with the new one.

  To start the server use something like:

    /usr/bin/killall synergys
    /usr/local/bin/synergys [<options>] --config <config-pathname>

  Again, <options> must not include `-f' or `--no-daemon'.  If
  the configuration pathname is one of the default locations then
  you don't need the `--config' option.

  Note that some display managers (xdm and kdm, but not gdm) grab
  the keyboard and do not release it until the user logs in, for
  security reasons.  This prevents a synergy server from sharing
  the mouse and keyboard until the user logs in.  It doesn't
  prevent a synergy client from synthesizing mouse and keyboard
  input, though.


Common Command Line Options
---------------------------
  -d, --debug <level>   use debugging level <level>
      --daemon          run as a daemon (Linux) or background (Windows)
  -f, --no-daemon       run in the foreground
  -n, --name <name>     use <name> instead of the hostname
      --restart         automatically restart on failures
  -1, --no-restart      do not restart on failure
  -h, --help            print help and exit
      --version         print version information and exit

Debug levels are from highest to lowest:  FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, NOTE,
INFO, DEBUG, DEBUG1, and DEBUG2.  Only messages at or above the given
level are logged.  Messages are logged to a terminal window when
running in the foreground.  Unix logs messages to syslog when running
as a daemon.  The Windows NT family logs messages to the event log
when running as a service.  The Windows 95 family shows FATAL log
messages in a message box and others in a terminal window when running
as a service.

The `--name' option lets the client or server use a name other than
its hostname for its screen.  This name is used when checking the
configuration.

Neither the client nor server will automatically restart if an error
occurs that is sure to happen every time.  For example, the server
will exit immediately if it can't find itself in the configuration.
On X11 both the client and server will also terminate if the
connection to the X server is lost.  Since xdm will normally restart
the X server and synergy, this is the correct behavior.


Server Command Line Options
---------------------------
  -a, --address <address>  listen for connections on the given address
  -c, --config <pathname>  read configuration from <pathname>

<address> has one of the following forms:
  <hostname>
  :<port>
  <hostname>:<port>
<hostname> is a hostname or address of a network interface on the
server system.  <port> is a port number from 1 to 65535.  <hostname>
defaults to the system's hostname and <port> defaults to 24800.


Client Command Line Options
---------------------------
  --camp                   retry connection to server until successful
  --no-camp                try connection to server only once
  <address>                address of server

see the "server command line options" for a description of <address>
but note that there is no default <hostname> though there is a
default <port>.
