Synergy To Do List
==================

Things to do to synergy, in no particular order:

* Provide GUI configuration

  There's a GUI tool on win32 but no other platforms.  It'd be nice
  if the tool allowed users to drag screen icons around to set the
  links between them, but this complicated because links aren't
  necessarily symmetrical.

* Provide taskbar feedback

  An icon indicating synergy's state in the taskbar would be nice.
  It could also provide a means for viewing recent log messages,
  stopping synergy, and forcing disconnection.

* Support non-ASCII keyboards

  Synergy currently supports only ASCII characters typed on the
  keyboard.  It does, however, support Unicode clipboard text.

* Write man/html pages

* Port to other platforms

  Most desired is MacOS X.

* Provide a nice win32 installer/uninstaller

  Synergy doesn't have any special needs so even just unzipping is
  satisfactory, but a proper installer would be nice.  And, more
  importantly, it should provide an uninstaller.

* Add more clipboard formats

  Synergy currently supports only text on the clipboard.  It should
  support more formats, such as images and sound.  For each format,
  some canonical type must be chosen.  For text, that's UTF-8 with
  \n for newlines.  For images, it might be BMP or PNG.  Whatever it
  is it should losslessly support any type it might be converted to.
  The type is converted to each platform's native type.  For example,
  BMP for images on win32.

* Keyboard shortcuts to jump from screen to screen

Then there are major new features:

* Provide a KVM mode

  In this mode synergy would share the monitor in addition to the
  keyboard and mouse.

* Add encryption and authentication

  Make synergy is safe to use on untrusted networks.

* Support for limited drag and drop between systems

* Support for (virtual) terminals on unix

  This would be useful in KVM mode to administer several remote
  headless systems that you don't want running X just so synergy
  can work.
