Synergy To Do List
==================

Things to do to synergy, in no particular order:

* Provide GUI configuration

  There's a GUI tool on win32 but no other platforms.  It'd be nice
  if the tool allowed users to drag screen icons around to set the
  links between them, but this complicated because links aren't
  necessarily symmetrical.

* Provide taskbar feedback

  An icon indicating synergy's state in the taskbar would be nice.
  It could also provide a means for viewing recent log messages,
  stopping synergy, and forcing disconnection.

* Support non-ASCII keyboards

  Synergy currently supports only ASCII characters typed on the
  keyboard.  It does, however, support Unicode clipboard text.

* Write man pages

* Finish PORTING guide

* Port to other platforms

  An incomplete list of desired platforms:
  * MacOS 9
  * MacOS 10
  * BSD
  * Irix
  * Solaris
  * HP-UX
  * AIX

* Provide a nice win32 installer/uninstaller

  Synergy doesn't have any special needs so even just unzipping is
  satisfactory, but a proper installer would be nice.  And, more
  importantly, it should provide an uninstaller.

* Add more clipboard formats

  Synergy currently supports only text on the clipboard.  It should
  support more formats, such as images and sound.  For each format,
  some canonical type must be chosen.  For text, that's UTF-8 with
  \n for newlines.  For images, it might be BMP or PNG.  Whatever it
  is it should losslessly support any type it might be converted to.
  The type is converted to each platform's native type.  For example,
  BMP for images on win32.
