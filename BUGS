Known Bugs in Synergy
=====================

Report bugs to:  synergy@groundhog.pair.com

When reporting bugs, please include the version of the operating
system you're using and what locale you use.

* Documentation is missing

  There are currently no man pages or other documents describing the
  usage of the various commands.

* Not all keystrokes are handled

  Certain keystrokes are not captured by the synergy server and,
  therefore, are not transmitted to secondary screens.  Which keys
  depends on the primary screen's platform:

  Linux:
    * ctrl+alt+del
    * ctrl+alt+backspace        (only if used by the X server)
    * ctrl+alt+keypad_plus      (only if used by the X server)
    * ctrl+alt+keypad_minus     (only if used by the X server)

  Windows NT family (except NT prior to service pack 3)
    * ctrl+alt+del
    * accessibility shortcuts (e.g. pressing shift 5 times for sticky keys)

  Windows 95 family (at NT prior to service pack 3)
    * ctrl+alt+del
    * ctrl+esc
    * alt+[shift+]tab
    * alt+[shift+]esc
    * windows+E
    * windows+[ctrl+]F
    * windows+[shift+]M
    * windows+R
    * windows+F1
    * windows+tab
    * windows+break
    * accessibility shortcuts (e.g. press shift 5 times for sticky keys)

* Non-ASCII keystrokes unsupported

  Only ASCII characters are decoded and transmitted by the server.
  However, the clipboard does support Unicode.

* Screen flashes (Windows)

  On Windows, the primary screen flashes when the cursor enters it.
  This is a consequence of how synergy captures input.

* Slow console text entry (Windows 95 family)

  Typing into a command prompt window on the Windows 95 family has
  very slow visual feedback.

* Event logs (Windows NT family)

  Synergy doesn't support event logs properly on the Windows NT family.
  In particular, the event message is reported in the extra data portion
  of the event instead of the normal message portion.

* NoInteractiveServices not handled (Windows NT family)

  Synergy does not (cannot) work when the NoInteractiveServices registry
  entry is set.  Synergy doesn't not gracefully handle it being set.

* Incorrectly hiding screen savers in certain situations (Windows)

  If turning off the screen saver on the primary screen requires a
  password on Windows then all of the secondary screen screen savers
  are deactivated when the password dialog appears.  If the password
  is not entered only the primary screen's screen saver is activated.

* Not handling strange keyboards (X11)

  Synergy does not detect keyboards with unusual behavior and may
  misbehave as a result.  Unusual behavior includes keyboards that
  don't report KeyRelease events and toggle keys that report KeyPress
  when toggled on and KeyRelease when toggled off (instead of KeyPress
  and KeyRelease for each physical press and release).

* Not handling mode-switch and shift-lock (X11)

  Synergy neither handles the mode-switch key nor shift-lock behavior
  (as opposed to caps-lock).

* Large Motif clipboard items are truncated (X11)

  Synergy doesn't yet fully implement Motif's protocol for large
  clipboard items.  As a result it silently truncates those items.
  Large depends on the X server but is probably around 256kB.

  Synergy also doesn't support by-name Motif clipboard items.  It
  will read no data at all for those items.

* Automake isn't fully configured (Linux)

  The automake configuration isn't complete so synergy won't build
  properly on some (many) systems.

* Only text is supported on the clipboard

  The clipboard supports Unicode and current locale encoded text but
  there are numerous other data types it should support, e.g. images,
  sound, raw binary data, etc.
