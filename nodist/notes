final preparation for release:
  create files:
    INSTALL -- configuration, build, and installation instructions
    NEWS -- recent project news
    COPYING -- pointer to LICENSE
    AUTHORS -- list of contributors
    ChangeLog
    LICENSE -- license
    MANIFEST -- list of files in distribution (?)
    FAQ -- frequently asked questions for project
    HISTORY -- project history

add copyright to every file

change README:
  should have:
    A brief description of the project.
    A pointer to the project website (if it has one)
    Notes on the developer's build environment and potential portability problems.
    A roadmap describing important files and subdirectories.
    Either build/installation instructions or a pointer to a file containing same (usually INSTALL).
    Either a maintainers/credits list or a pointer to a file containing same (usually CREDITS).
    Either recent project news or a pointer to a file containing same (usually NEWS).

make man pages
  docbook?
  should have makefile target to build these

add make rules to install files

custom make targets:
  make doxygen documents
  make binary and/or source rpm
    should auto generate spec file, pulling in proper version number
    source rpm should use BuildRoot to build in /tmp or /var/tmp
  create tarball:
	foobar-$(VERS).tar.gz:
	  @ls $(SRC) | sed s:^:foobar-$(VERS)/: >MANIFEST
	  @(cd ..; ln -s foobar foobar-$(VERS))
	  (cd ..; tar -czvf foobar/foobar-$(VERS).tar.gz `cat foobar/MANIFEST`)
	  @(cd ..; rm foobar-$(VERS))

configure not caching results
  is that normal or did we disable it unintentionally

---
not handling large motif selections
  don't know protocol for transfer

---
not handling international characters

---
CServer::setConfig() should update network ports
  if the server address or http address change then the old ports
  should be closed and new ones opened.

---
try to determine X11 keyboard quirks automatically
  in particular, set the half-duplex flags
  maybe KBD extension will help determine this

bug with half-duplex keys
  win32 server sent num-lock to grace
  grace converts to half-duplex so only synthesizes key down
  now grace starts server and is locked to screen
  grace should ignore half duplex keys when seeing if locked to screen

---
HTTP stuff
  no way to save config using HTTP
    should have a button or a page to force save of config
    or just save config every time it's changed
  should use authentication (at least basic)
  provide way to kill/restart server via HTTP
  provide way to query why locked to screen?
    handy for debugging at least

  bug in updating screens
	saw a goofy set of screens after update
	i think the config was similar to:
      A B
      C
      D E

---
win32:
  need icon
  provide taskbar icon
  provide control panel?

win32 service:
  need message table for proper event reporting

desktop switcher program failure when running synergy as service
  returns access denied from CreateDesktop()
  don't know why

---
hot keys
  should have keyboard shortcuts to jump to screens

---
should switch to user nobody (or something similar) if running as root
  for security reasons
  will make it impossible to overwrite /etc/synergy.conf
    if that file is only root writable (as it should be)

---
xscreensaver won't start if pointer on secondary screen
  unless using MIT or SGI screen saver extensions
  otherwise it cannot know when to stop the screen saver
    cos it can't grab mouse and keyboard

---
all screensavers hidden when showing win32 screensaver lock window
  win32 kills the screen saver and shows the lock window
  synergy thinks the screen saver is dead (cos the process is)
    deactivates secondary screen screen savers
  user is constrained to locked display, though
  also, we don't detect screen saver restarting if user doesn't unlock screen

---
not distinguishing between caps lock and shift lock
  In Caps Lock mode, the alphabetic keys send their uppercase (shifted) char-
  acter when pressed alone. For Caps Lock mode, pressing and releasing the
  lock key turns on the mode and pressing and releasing the lock key again
  turns off the mode. In Shift Lock mode, all keys on the main keypad send
  their shifted character when pressed alone. For Shift Lock mode, pressing
  and releasing the Lock key turns on the mode, and pressing and releasing
  either the Lock or the Shift key turns off the mode.

---
need timeout on CXWindowsClipboard::CReply objects
  should flush replies that are too old
  assumption is that requestor is broken

---
avoid fullscreen transparent window on win32
  using CBT hook to discard activation/focus messages
    but it's not being called when we lose keyboard input
  also, we sometimes don't get the keyboard input to start with

---
keyboard hook problems (win32)
  now passing keyboard events through in most cases
    this fixes problem on isabel where toggle lights don't toggle
    and num-lock behaved incorrectly (generated wrong keys).
    seems the DefWindowProc() needed to process the keys
  unfortunately, keys sometimes leak into wrong app.  seems related
    to times when we don't get the keyboard input.  key events are
    not delivered to app on primary until cursor returns to primary.
    no idea how that's possible.
  current have some code to check active window and reset it in
    keyboard hook.  that code doesn't work.
  seem to be having problems with windows key now, too.  looks like
    a down is sent but not the corresponding up so secondary system
    thinks the key is always down.

---
key events sent to console on win me (95/98?) are very slow
  1/4 to 1/2 second delay before key up is processed
  key up log message is also delayed
    console causing a system-wide delay?

---
adjust thread priorities on win32
  maybe remove changes altogether
  currently isabel starts single-stepping mouse when dragging window
    sometimes it goes normal speed but it's mostly very slow
    even a very high priority doesn't seem to help
      haven't tried real-time priority
  a very high priority on client fixes delay when typing into console
  is it the output console causing the slowness?

disable ctrl+alt+del info:
  SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETSCREENSAVERRUNNING, TRUE, &dummy, 0)
    fools system into thinking screen saver is running
    that disables ctrl+alt+del, alt+tab, ctrl+esc
    dunno if keystrokes are queued
    may be limited to win 95/98/me
  win nt sp 3 and above:
    low-level keyboard hook is called before ctrl+esc, alt+tab, alt+esc
    use that to capture and disable
    seems that low-level hook is notified of ctrl+alt+del but can't stop it
  win nt sp 2 and below
    ctrl+esc can be disabled by replacing task manager (dunno how)
    RegisterHotKey() can be used to catch alt+tab and alt+esc
      only while app is running, of course
  win nt
    keyboard filter driver can capture keys (see win NT DDK)
  http://216.239.51.100/search?q=cache:q-f03UHhFMMC:www.thescarms.com/VBasic/StopReBoot.asp+alt%2Btab+disable&hl=en
    some info on changing keyboard scan code mapping
    can be used to disable keys but looks like reboot is required

---
Q179905
  suggestion for bypassing hook code when called by debugger.
  may prevent system from getting locked up when debugging.

---
win32 rel notes:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows\NoInteractiveServices
    can prevent an interactive service from running interactively.
    how can we tell if we're not running interactively?
    even if not interactive we can use MessageBox() to alert user
      use MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION flag
      must use a separate thread in initialization if called from handler
      must close dialog if CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT is received
        see SetConsoleCtrlHandler() and CLog (which uses it)
    maybe possible to get around NoInteractiveServices
      modify DACLs on windows station/desktops to impersonate logged on user
      see "Interacting with the User by a Win32 Service"

---
unix release notes:
  restarting fails to connect until a user logs in:
    Xlib: no protocol specified
    this is caused by login manager
      all clients are rejected, except those started by manager itself
    workaround is to have synergy started by login manager
      should then use --no-restart, though that's not necessary
    affects client and server
  cannot switch screens on login screen:
    xdm,kdm grab keyboard for duration of login screen
    synergy cannot switch unless it can grab keyboard
    gdm doesn't appear to grab keyboard or mouse for duration
    affects server, only

=== feedback ===
send all toggle states instead of (individual) toggle ups/downs (gspencer)
  Actually, Teleffect already does that too, but what I meant was that
  each time the state of a "toggle" key (caps lock, scroll lock, num lock)
  changes on the master, I think it should force the client to take on
  that state, instead of just toggling on the client.  That way when Word
  (on the client) helpfullly turns off the caps lock, it doesn't get
  toggled back on when I turn off the caps lock on the master.  Ideally,
  it would just notice that Word turned off the caps lock on the client
  and turn it off on the master (and all other clients) too, but I think
  that's probably too complicated to implement.

double clicking NT binaries fails (liz)
  add note to README or use separate binaries for services.  client
  would also need a dialog to query options.  server would probably
  need one too.  use dialogs if there are no command line args.

how to exit (liz)
  no good way to exit on windows

win32 console disappears too quickly (liz)
  maybe show a message box if exiting to due an error

better support for reloading configuration (liz)
  use SIGHUP on unix
  use an app message on win32
    provide access through a control panel or taskbar icon

non-functional on ctrl+alt+del screen in win2k (kurt)
  i suppose it must be when win2k is the client.  mouse input wasn't
  working.  keyboard probably didn't work either.

automake stuff
  rebuild:
    * 'touch NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog'
    * 'touch stamp-h'
    * 'aclocal'     - creates aclocal.m4
    * 'autoconf'    - creates configure from configure.in
    * 'autoheader'  - creates config.h.in
    * 'automake'    - Creates Makefile.in from Makefile.am
    * './configure' - creates Makefile from Makefile.in
    * 'make'

  funky functions:
    snprintf -- ick!
      some return negative value -- no problem
      some return truncated length -- uh oh
      some return buffer length without truncation -- huh?
      some actually overrun the buffer -- must not build on those!

  use AC_LIBOBJ(function) for missing/broken functions
    adds function.c to build
    must add @LIBOBJS@ to *_LIBADD
  or AC_REPLACE_FUNCS(function ...)
    automatically calls AC_LIBOBJ for missing functions
  use AC_CHECK_FUNC or AC_CHECK_FUNCS to detect missing functions
    use AC_CHECK_LIB first if function not in std C lib

  maybe AC_CHECK_TYPE for size_t and ssize_t

replace sys/time.h with:
#if TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME
#	include <sys/time.h>
#	include <time.h>
#else
#	if HAVE_SYS_TIME_H
#		include <sys/time.h>
#	else
#		include <time.h>
#	endif
#endif

  what does `make install' do?

  check in derived files?

can we use AC_REPLACE_FUNCS and only build the missing function files
in a single directory.  do we have to have a separate configure.in
script to do that?
